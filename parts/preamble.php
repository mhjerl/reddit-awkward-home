    <h2>General Introduction: How to use Comment Tags</h2>
	<h4>To me, there are two aspects of using Comment Tags and learning how to use them: There's a fight aspect and a comfortablenes aspect.</h4>
	<br>
	<h3>The Fight Aspect of using Comment Tags</h3>
	<h4>The fight-aspect is easy to understand and the easiest to misunderstand. There are some things we fight for in conversations on reddit when using the tags (directness, order, honesty, simplicity) and some thing we fight against (inappropriate third-person intrusion in bilateral disputes, carelesness, scorn, harassment and lack of respect). We're not fighting people and we're not fighting so much for these ideals and visions that we forget people. We must not forget the respect of other people, decency, compassion, tolerance, etc. The tags are NOT meant to fight other people by using the tags randomly or with the aim of treating other people randomly. You agree to a set of rules when you sign up with us. Redditors who don't follow these rules will get banned from Comment Tag after getting warned.</h4>

	<h3>The Comfortableness Aspect of using Comment Tags</h3>
	<h4>Unfortunately it's much easier to learn how to fight online with these tags than to learn how to make people comfortable. Our aim is certainly not to moralize or reject the existence of negative feelings, conflicts, aggression and the realities of being human. Rather, our aim is to tame our own expectations. Within the hearts of each of us. We're not "introducing love, compassion and decency on reddit", redditors takes care of that themselves. Completely independently of the existence of Comment Tags and the Comment Tag Cloud. Comment Tag is a supplement and not a miracle solution. There's probably no other way to spread comfortableness than getting in the habit of using them in a careful way. After all, nobody has ever seen these tags before. To me, awkwardness, feeling the awkwardness, is the key to a good start.</h4>
